# GameTestingConcepts

After watching some the testing activities required to test Halo, name two skills that are important for a tester to have?

- Knowledge of human psyche in order to know whether other people will have fun playing the game or not. 
- Creativity to find new ways to break the game so it can be fixed before release.



What do you think is hardest about being a tester based watching the video?

- Repeating the same action multiple times to find out if the function will break after X-amount of times.



What is something new you learned about being a tester? Or something you found interesting?

- Watching other people play your game is painful. Without the knowledge of what to do, it can be very irritating when you can't tell the player/tester what to do or where to go to make progress. The amount of times they said they jumped in the video was absolutely amazing. 15,000 times... I would actually cry.
